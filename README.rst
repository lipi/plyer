Plyer
=====

Plyer is a platform-independent api to use features commonly found on various
platforms, notably mobile ones, in Python.

How

Plyer tries not to reinvent the wheel, and will call for external libraries to
implement the api in the easiest way, depending on the current platform.

- on python-for-android, pyjnius is used
- on kivy-ios, pyobjus is used
- on windows/mac/linux, commonly found libraries and programs will be used
